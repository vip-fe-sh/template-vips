# vip-vue-webpack-boilerplate

> A full-featured Webpack setup with hot-reload, lint-on-save, resource fetch & css extraction, extended from [vue-template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack)

### Before You Start...

This boilerplate is targeted towards large, serious projects and contains a lot of moving pieces. If you just want to try out `vue-loader` or whip out a quick prototype, use the [webpack-simple](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack-simple) template instead.

## Usage

This is a project template for [vip-cli](https://github.com/vip-fe-sh/vip-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vip-cli
$ vip init vips vip-project
$ cd vip-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## What's Included

- `npm run dev`: first-in-class development experience.
  - Run webpack dev server
  - State preserving hot-reload
  - State preserving compilation error overlay
  - Lint-on-save with ESLint
  - Source maps

- `npm run build`: Production ready build.
  - JavaScript minified with [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2).
  - HTML minified with [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier).
  - CSS across all components extracted into a single file and minified with [cssnano](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano).
  - All static assets compiled with version hashes for efficient long-term caching, and a production `index.html` is auto-generated with proper URLs to these generated assets.
  - Also see [deployment notes](#how-do-i-deploy-built-assets-with-my-backend-framework).

For a better understanding of how things work, consult the docs for respective projects listed. In particular, [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).
